            This group project was used to demonstrate concepts we learned in our Machine Vision and Digital Control Systems class.
            Simply put, this project was a candy sorter. We designed the project inefficiently for the purpose of demonstrating our core class concepts.
            The design on the right consists of a rotary manipulator arm capable of pushing objects off the round plate shown. The plate
            itself was set to a constant speed to give the project some complexity regarding object velocity on the plate. Suspended above 
            this system is a camera, which was used as our sole feedback mechanism, providing machine vision data. This data was collected
            using a the OpenCV-Python wrapper sent via serial connection to an ATmega328p, running a PID algorithm, which controlled the 
            various motor controlers. Below shows a video of the project.
