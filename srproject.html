        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Introduction</h2>
        <p>
                DispenSUM was a project motivated by the huge problem surrounding medication adherence. So we started our project by asking various experts for opinion, not only about the device specifically 
            but how prevelent of a problem medication adherence actually was. From there we produced a problem statement centered around the ideals we deem appropriate and came to name our device off these 
            principals: Safety, Usability, Medication Adherence. These principals guided us through our whole design and prototype phases, keeping our focus and allowing more productive discussion.
            With a strong goal in mind, our team proceeded with design.

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Device Description</h2>
        <p>
            The DispenSUM platform provides a new method of medication adherence by reducing the patient’s required effort to organize, store, refill, and remember when as well as how much of each medication
            they must take. The machine works in a simple manner, the cartridge arrives at the patient’s door pre-loaded 
            with their persciption medication and a dosing schedule stored in onboard RFID chip memory. The patient simply taps the cartridge to the side of the machine, which loads the dosing schedule into the machine, and 
            is instructed to place the cartridge into the available slot. The device emits sound and light notifications for the user once a dispense is ready. The user then clicks a button, allowing the device to dispense all applicable pills. Check out the <a href="srproject.html#vid">video</a> below to get an overview of the system.
        </p>
        <p>
                DispenSUM also has some more advanced features that demonstrate our commitment to quality systems. Many redundant systems are used in the device such as, limit switch homing, weight sensing and pill proximity protection. Another source of redundancy comes from reading and re-reading RFID tags to check integrity and ensure the system wasn't tampered. In addition, DispenSUM logs paitent data to prevent overdose and provide evidence of dispense. DispenSUM will email caretakers or loved ones when a dosage is missed.
