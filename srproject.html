        <p>
                DispenSUM was motivated by the huge problem surrounding medication non-adherence. We started our project by asking various experts for opinion, not only about the device specifically 
            but how prevalent of a problem medication non-adherence actually was. We found medication non-adherence is a huge <a class="hyperlink" href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/consumer-healthcare/medication-information/medication-adherence-taking-your-meds-as-directed">problem</a>. 
			In addition, we were surprised to learn how much
			of an impact medication non-adherence had on the whole health care <a class="hyperlink" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3191684/">system</a>. Medication especially plays a large role in the
			lives of those <a class="hyperlink" href="https://assets.aarp.org/rgcenter/health/rx_midlife_plus.pdf">50 and older</a> and compliance to pharmacological therapies is crucial for the efficiency of the drugs they take.
			From there we produced a problem statement centered around the ideals we deem appropriate and came to name our device off these 
            principals: Safety, Usability, Medication Adherence. The device had to cater to an older, more forgetful population while maintaining simplicity, usability and above all safety. 
			These principals guided us through our whole design and prototype phases, keeping our focus and allowing more productive discussion.
			We decided to embark on creating an all-in-one medication management system that could time, dose and supply all medications an individual needs.
            With a strong goal in mind, our team proceeded with design.

        <p>
            The DispenSUM platform provides a new method of medication adherence by reducing the patient’s required effort to organize, store, refill, and remember when as well as how much of each medication
            they must take. The machine works in a simple manner, the cartridge is picked up at the pharmacy preloaded 
            with the patients prescription medication and dosing schedule stored in on-board RFID chip memory. The patient simply loads the cartridge into machine, which loads the prescription information and dosing schedule into the machine. 
			The device emits sound and light notifications for the user once a dispense is ready and is capable of sending push/email notifications to the user's cellular device. The user then clicks a button, allowing the device to dispense all applicable medications into one cup. 
			With dispenSUM, users will never forget to take their medications again or double dose as this device provides timed, accurate, and consistent medication.
			Check out the <a href="srproject.html#vid">video</a> below to get an overview of the system.

                DispenSUM also has some more advanced features that demonstrate our commitment to quality systems. Many redundant systems are used in the device such as, limit switch homing, weight sensing and pill proximity detection. 
				Another source of redundancy comes from reading and re-reading RFID tags to check integrity and ensure the system wasn't tampered. 
				In addition, DispenSUM logs patient data to prevent overdose and provide evidence of dispense. DispenSUM will email caretakers or loved ones when a dosage is missed.
