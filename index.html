        <p>
            I am a newly graduated BS in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from California State University Sacramento. My passion lies in the realm of Robotics, Automation, and Programming.
            I currently work a manufacturing internship job at Gold Standard Diagnostics where I assemble three types of medical diagnostic robotic equipment.
            Recently I have been assisting in validation of chemiluminescent immunoassay(CLIA) hardware as a part of the validation team in addition to manufacturing and troubleshooting.
            My senior project was an automated medication dispenser and was appropriately named Dispensum. Robotics became a passion of mine since I was a Junior in high school and participated in FIRST&reg Robotics Challenge.
            I have also grown increasingly interested in innovation in the medical field as I'd developed a good understanding of it. I will be using this website as a tool to document my engineering developement, my projects, and my milestones.

                Almost everyone must take medication in their lifetime. <a class="hyperlink" href="http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/More/ConsumerHealthCare/Medication-Adherence---Taking-Your-Meds-as-Directed_UCM_453329_Article.jsp#.WdvCvWhSzcs">Research</a>
                shows, poor medication adherence takes the lives of 125,000 Americans annually and costs nearly $300 billion a year in additional use of the medical system. The problem acts as a catalyst to seemingly limitless
                <a class="hyperlink" href="http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/medication-management-market.html"> markets</a> and innovations.
                Our <a href="srproject.html">DispenSUM</a> device provides a new method of medication adherence by reducing the patient’s required effort to organize, store, refill, and remember when as well as how much of each medication they must take.
                The uniqueness of the machine is primarily due to the implementation of cheap to manufacture and reusable medication cartridge.
                The cartridge arrives at the patient’s door pre-loaded with their required medication and a dosing schedule stored in onboard memory.
                The patient simply taps the cartridge to the side of the machine, which loads the dosing schedule into the machine, and is instructed to place the cartridge into an available slot.
